# Working through "Deep Learning and the Game of Go"


* Note for future use, the parts I did not work through (only read) are Chapter 11,13 and 14.

* Also I had almost no success with the policy gradient training after hours of trying different training parameters. (See PolicyGradientNotes.md). If this were a research project I would probably have (incorrectly) concluded that this is a dead end. Kudos to those who pushed throuhg.

* Tried also Actor Critic model, see notes therin, but basically there is a known bug that causes the loss to diverge unless the learning rate is too low to make any real progress.   

* Closing this down for now (March 9 2022) and on to more productive things!
